### Summary
- design test subsets
- **daikon** is invariant-based bug detection using patterns dynamically

### [Fault, Error, Failure](https://bitbucket.org/lintan/testing18/raw/b93cad84c4bf15eb63cefa1d4f77678163311ea4/03-FaultErrorFailure.pdf)
- Fault == Bug, incorrect code
- Error is incorrect, unobserved state
- Failure is externally incorrect behaviour
- program counter is the instruction that has been executed
- an error is the first state where it does not follow specification

Program must be RIP for a failure to occur: Reachable, incorrect state, propagates to output

Avoidance, Detection (testing), Tolerance (redundancy)

### Structural Coverage
Static Testing at compile time involves review through code inspection (code review)

Dynamic Testing includes black and white box testing

Need testing critera to define coverage 
- test case is fed into a program, many is a test set
  - prefix and postfix values as specification
- measuring test set effectiveness depends on use case/criteria
- **coverage**: given set of test requirements `TR` for a coverage criterion `C`, a test set `T` satisfies `C` iff forall `tr` in `TR`, exists some `t` in `T` s.t. `t` satisfies `tr`
- coverage level helps us evaluate effectiveness of a test set, helps to find infeasible test requirements

**Subsumption**: a test criterion C1 subsumes C2 iff forall test sets that satisfy C1 also satisfy C2. In other words, A subsumes B if it's a strictly weaker coverage criterion
- edge coverage subsumes node coverage
- branch coverage subsumes statement (node) coverage

Buffer overflow is a common security vulnerability, and occurs when input overruns a buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory.

Graph Theory Review highlights:
- simple path
- **test path** is a path that starts and ends at two specific nodes
- paths in CFG are based on syntax, may  not correspond to semantically (something that's always false could still be a path)
  - syntactically vs. semantically reachable nodes
  - semantic reachability is undecidable (NP complete)

When talking about node or edges in a graph G in **coverage criterion**, generally syntactically reachable

**Single Entry Single Exit graphs:** Type of control flow graph where all test paths start at a single node and end at another

we have some mapping `pathG` from our test cases to test paths
- test case can be funciton input, test path is the code conditional flow based on input

**Node Coverage**: forall nodes in reachG[N0], our TR specifies some requirement to visit node n

**Edge Coverage:** all reachable paths of length 1 are required to be visited based on our TR (includes the 0 edges case too)
- Edge coverage => Node coverage

**Edge Pair Coverage**:** TR contains each reachable path of length up to and including 2, in G.

**Simple Path** has no duplicate nodes except possibly at its ends
- no internal loop, bound their length

**Prime Path** is simple and does not appear as a subpath of any other simple path
- prime path coverage if TR contains each prime path in G
- Complete path coverage contains all paths in G
- Specified Path coverage contains a specified set S of paths
- *will need to find all prime paths*

Test paths are not a subset of Prime Paths
