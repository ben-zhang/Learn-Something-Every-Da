# MATH 135: Algebra for Honour's Mathematics
### Divisibility
#### Transitivity of Divisibility (TD)
Shows that divisibility is transitive: `If a|b and b|c, a|c`
#### Divisibility of Integer Combination (DIC)
`If a|b and a|c, then a|(bx + cy)`
#### Bounds by Divisibilty (BBD)
The denominator must be smaller if divisible: `If a|b and b≠0, then |a|≤|b|`
#### Divison Algorithm
There exists q and r s.t. b = aq + r, where 0 ≤ r < a

For proofs, try contradictions, contra-positives or direct proofs. For induction, find a statement P(n) that is true or false. Show that P(1) is true. Assume P(k) is true. Show that P(k+1) is true.

Congruences can add, subtract, multiply. To divide, apply CD. To simplify exponents, apply FlT.

For simultaneous congruences, use chinese remainder theorem.

For Linear congruences, apply knowledge of Linear Diophantine Equations.
