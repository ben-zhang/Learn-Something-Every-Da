# Filing US taxes
1. As a Canadian student, file the Non Resident (NR) federal form, specifically [1040NR](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040nr.pdf).
- need W2(s), T5 for foreign dividends (ordinary vs. qualified)
  - all dividends are ordinary, some are qualified which means you pay less tax?

Steps for 1040NR
- sum the state wages together from W2s, put on line 8 (wages)
- sum dividends from T5s, put on line 10b as qualified dividends
- looking at the [2106 form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2106.pdf) for expenses, doesn't apply to interns for flights (must pass time test, 39+ weeks of work). Communting is not a deductible expense. So this extra form doesn't apply.
- for line 42, look up [tax table](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040nr.pdf) in instructions to determine how much tax to owe
  - number may need adjustment for qualified dividends, see [qualified dividends and capital gain tax worksheet](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040nr.pdf)
- So now we need to calculate Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Basically if you take too many deductions, you still owe a certain minimum amount. To find this, fill in form [6251](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f6251.pdf) if your total from line 39 (net income before exemptions) plus numbers from itemized deductions (line 1 and 13)
  - in instructions, each line number has specifics for filing 1040NR, follow those
  - if you filled out qualified dividends, fill out part 3
