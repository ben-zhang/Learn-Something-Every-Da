# MATH 119
## Pre midterm
- Taylor Series
 - Taylor polynomials and Taylor's Inequality
 - Big O suste,
- Basic Series
 - sinx = sum((-1)^k * x^(2k+1)) / (2k+1)!
 - cosx = sum((-1)^k * x^(2k)) / (2k)!
 - e^x = sum (x^k/k!)
 - 1/(1-x)
- Convergence of infinite series 
- Power series
 - Radius and Interval of Convergence (when the power series converges to the exact value of the function)
 - Manipulation of power series (integrate, differentiate, divide by x)
 - Multiplying power series is messy without Big O

## Post Midterm
- Graphing scalar fields 
- Partial derivatives (fx, fy, fxx, fxy, fyy)
- Two-variable Taylor Series with linear approximation (tangent plane)
- Differentials
- Parametric Equations (vector fields, vector functions)
- vector function r(t) = (x(t), y(t))
- velocity vector r'(t) = (x'(t), y'(t)), acceleration vector r"(t) = (x"(t), y"(t))
- Chain Rule with trees
- Gradiant vector ∇f = (fx, fy) ( think of it as the derrivative of a field )
 - can find greatest slope is in the direction of ∇f(a,b)
 - greatest slope is ||∇f(a,b)||
 - can be used to find critical points
- Unconstrained optimization (critical points and **classification**, know the formula)
- Constrained optimization ( optimization in a closed region ) ∇f = λ∇g
- Double/Triple integration
 - Change of variable, coordinate systems
