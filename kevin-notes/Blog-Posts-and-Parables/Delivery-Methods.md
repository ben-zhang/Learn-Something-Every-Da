General learnings about Agile:
- Agile is about collaboration
- estimate tasks based on relative difficulty
  - should be effort, composed of difficulty, time, brainpower, unknowns, risk
- scoring tasks is for the leaders to estimate how much their team can commit to
- purpose of daily rituals are to share wins, blocks, progress, timeline, learnings relevant to other tasks, day availability  

### [History of Agile Manifesto](https://www.smartsheet.com/comprehensive-guide-values-principles-agile-manifesto)
- individuals and interactions over process and tools
  - communicate as needed rather than scheduled
- working software over documentation
  - stories supplement software specifications by documenting requirements
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - customer is engaged throughout the process rather than providing specs and evaluating the final product
- responding to change over following a plan
- see [notes on a study related to agile](../Research-Papers/Agile%20Development%20Method%20in%20Use.md)
