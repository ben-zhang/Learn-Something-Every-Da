# Theory of Mind
Much like [sonder](http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/23536922667/sonder), theory of mind is the idea that other's also have a mind, and that we can be aware of others' perspective, beliefs and desires. It says that the mind is the only thing being directly observed, and that we can see our own mind through introspection.
- explains why we physiologically synchronize with others around us
  - in video games, heart rates/breathing can synchronize with teammates
- human's tend to visualize others' perspective by physiologically synchronizing with them to gain more empathy
- overall, theory of mind is a phenomenon that people use to have empathy for others, and is important for social skills

### Occam's Razor
Problem solving principle that typically the simplest solution is the right one; the solution that makes the least assumptions.
- simple theories are more testable and can be more easily proven false
- each assumption has a probability of being wrong, and composing these together makes complex solutions more likely to fail or be incorrect
