# Indexing
Optimize read time, aiming for sub-linear time efficiency at the cost of extra write time
- done so by constructing an index data-structure whose implementation varies based on what operations we want to optimize
- important for validations on uniqueness and other database constraints
  - corresponding index is created implicitly for constraints

### Non-clustered
Physical order of rows is not preserved, but the index specifies logical ordering
- indexed columns are typically non-primary keys, used for JOIN, WHERE and ORDER BY
- index tree holds index keys in sorted order, with pointers to the records (page in page organized or row offset in file organized) 
- more scalable, but reduced read speeds

### Clustered
Alters the data into a certain distinct order to match the index
- only one clustered index per table, but increases sequential reads (because of hardware burst reads)

### Clusters
Index for join operations, records for the tables that share some cluster key are stored together physically for faster read times (less I/O operations)
