# Time Series Databases -- [source](http://jmoiron.net/blog/thoughts-on-timeseries-databases/)
Time series modelling is important as data sets grow
- a series is identified by a source name/ID
  - consists of a sequence of {timestamp, value}
  - ordered by timestamp, using high-precision Unix timestamp tupled with a float
- time series databases should be optimized for lots of writes (think 99% of operations)
- writes are generally sequential appends
- bulk deletes for a metric
- updates are rare
- data can be immutable in general, since writes are usually for recent timestamps and generally do not change
  - think preserving history of time series
- data reads are generally sequential
- concurrent reads are common

### Performance Characteristics
- distributed by design (not encouraging sharding)
  - fault-tolerance and high availability
- send the query to the data
- each node should aim for efficiency 
- able to take advantage of powerful hardware (lots of RAM, many CPU cores); no single writer systems
- fast and consistent, no stalls freezes
- we need non-blocking backups for failovers
- auto scaling without downtime/locking
- compressibility of data

### Language & API Design
Want to avoid some legacy of SQL
- SQL tables are fixed width and grow downwards
  - cannot span rows without doing a JOIN
- in time-series, rows are series identified by primary key and grow sideways
- language should permit a GROUP BY functionality both vertically (between metrics) and horizontally (over time)
  - both rows and columns are addressable by keys instead of literal identifiers
  - strict equality and ranges
- should support server-side processing for expressions, aggregate functions
  - resampling into time resolutions different from the storage resolution (apply averaging transformations to simplify data)
  - time series expressions (sum, division, ordering, ranking, limiting)
- times series query language should be designed for analytics
- tagging events (name=value pairs), to individual time series points, which can help for more efficient queries related to the tag at the given time (think tailored filtering)

### Log-structured merge-tree: Optimizing Writes -- [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree)
A time-series database should be well optimized for reads (usability) and writes (for scalability)
- cannot use sql-like indexed collection (key, timestamp, value) rows, because then you have to query across all rows at worst
- TODO
