# Packer
Tool for creating machine images. Can create identical images for multiple platforms from a single config. This includes AMIs for EC2.
- images let you deploy instances in seconds rather than minutes/hours
- multi-platform means you can test locally on a VM and deploy to production on AWS with identical images
