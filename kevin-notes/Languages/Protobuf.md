# Protocol Buffers
Write a `.proto` file defining data structures, use the compiler to generate accessors for any language
- useful for microservices (language agnostic)
- more efficient (space and serialization time) than xml
- defines types
- messages are used to pass data between processes
- services defines an RPC service interface, gives you stubs which you replace with an implementation
