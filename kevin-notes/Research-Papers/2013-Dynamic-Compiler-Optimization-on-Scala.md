# [An Experimental Study of the Influence of Dynamic
Compiler Optimizations on Scala Performance](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2489846)
- JVMs are optimized for performace on traditional Java benchmarks
- JVM is useful as a target for many languages other than java, like Scala and Clojure directly or JRuby and Jython with additional infrastructure 
- performance testing is based on a diverse set of applications: numbber crunching (sci-mark). tools (DaCapo), enterprise-level servers
  - all in java code
