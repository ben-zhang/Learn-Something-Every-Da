# [An empirical study on the correctness of formally verified distributed systems](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pfonseca/papers/eurosys2017-dsbugs.pdf)
By far the biggest group of bugs relate to assumptions about the behaviour of components that the formally verified system interacts with
- specifically the shim layer between the system and its OS
- verification is very effective for reducing protocol errors
