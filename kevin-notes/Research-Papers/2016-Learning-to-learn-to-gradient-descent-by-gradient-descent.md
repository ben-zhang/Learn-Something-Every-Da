Optimization algorithms are still designed by hand. This paper casts optimization problem design as a learning problem
- Hessian Matrix corrects naive gradient descent by accounting for second order information
- convex optimization is a subfield of optimization, minimizing convex functions over convex sets
- deep learning has seen a proliferation of optimization methods for high dimensional, non convex optimization problems
- optimizers are designed by communities addressing localized subproblems and exploiting inherent structure of the problems
- roughly, optimizer g has parameters &phi;, then the optimizee f is of the form &theta;t+1 = &theta;t + gt(&nabla;f(&theta;t), &phi;)
- deep learning is good for generalizing a specialized optimization to other new sub-structures

### Learning to learn with recurrent neural network
By applying meta-learning, we are essentially recursively applying a learning algorithm on itself. This process is a recurrent neural network (RNN), formed by a directed, cyclic graph
- activation function of a node defines the output of that node 
- each unit has a time-varying real valued activation
- each edge (connection) has a modifiable weight

LSTM (Long short-term memory) is a recurrent neural network architecture
- well suited for learning form experience to classify, process and predict time series when there is long lag between important events
- LSTM units are introduced (excels at remembering values for either long or short durations)
- no activation function within its recurrent component, so not iteravely squashed over time and gradient term does not vanish when Backpropagation through time is applied

In this work, they directly parameterize the optimizer, define a good optimizer as one with low expected loss, given a distribution of functions f

Challenge: optimizing tens of thousands of parameters; not feasible through a fully connected RNN (huge hidden state)
