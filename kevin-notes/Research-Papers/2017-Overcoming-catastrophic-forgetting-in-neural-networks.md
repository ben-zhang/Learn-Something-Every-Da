# [Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks 2017](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/03/13/1611835114.full.pdf?with-ds=yes)
Previously, forgetting was seen as an intrinsic part of neural networks (task to task). This paper shows that it is possible to overcome this limitation
- typically, a neural network trained for a sequence of tasks quickly forgets the weighting for the previous task, to meet the objective of the new task
