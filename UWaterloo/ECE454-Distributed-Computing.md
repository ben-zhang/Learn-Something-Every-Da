# Distributed Computing
- Distributed systems are often organized as middleware
  - offers single-system view
- **distribution transparency** is a desirable property for middleware, that hides the fact that processes/resources are physically distributed
- openness arises from interoperability, composability, extensibility, and separation of policy from mechanism (through config files)
