- A **primative** is not a **power**
- P<sub>2</sub> means the set of all primatives over the alphabet of length 2: {0,1}
- `x ле y` means shuffle, as in shuffling a deck (interleave)
- lexicographic order is defined for same length strings
- **radix order** sorts first by length then lexicographical
- z is **purely periodic** if z = x^omega for some finite x
- z is **ultimately periodic** if the suffix is purely periodic
- x and y are **conjugates** if x is a cyclic shift of y
- x is a **border** of y if x is not empty, x != y, x is prefix and suffix of y "entaglement"
- Lyndon-Schutzenberger 1st theorem, the "alfalfa" theorem
