# Theory of Computing

### 1 [Background](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/CS360/Lectures/01.pdf)
Computational problems themselves can be viewed as mathematical objects
- a set `A` is countable iff there is an injective function from A -> Natural numbers
- if set `A` is infinite, it is countable if there's a bijection (total)
- recall the power set is the set of all subsets of a set
- one proof pattern is breaking down a set into finite lists of sets for the purpose of enumeration
