# Setup

A few notes regarding challenges I encountered while forking this repo from @kevintpeng

1. Change the git repo you're pushing to in deploy.sh
2. Change your name in deploy.sh
3. You don't have to add a User key. A read-write deploy key works just fine
4. Leave the hostname blank or "github.com" for your read-write deploy key
5. Add the appropriate keys in the add-ssh-keys lines in config.yml
6. Delete my notes, replace them with your own.
