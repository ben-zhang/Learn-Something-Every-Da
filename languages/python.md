# Python

### os library
The **os** library is a collection of miscellaneous operating system interfaces.

**os.environ** acts similarly to a grouping of environment variables.



### virtualenv

**virtualenv** is a dependency management tool that can be used to create isolated Python environments. **virtualenv** creates a folder that contains all necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need. Usually, people use virtualenv as an alternative to pipenv, a similar, more high-level tool.

Using virtualenv:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
