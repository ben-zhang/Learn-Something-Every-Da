### Oh-my-zsh
The repo for oh-my-zsh can be found [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
It's a wrapper for zsh that makes managing the zsh install much easier. It comes with some nice colors and is, in my opinion, less cluttered than bash .

Consider also installing [powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
